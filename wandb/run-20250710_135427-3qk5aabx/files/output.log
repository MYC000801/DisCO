/projectnb/replearn/mingyu/anaconda/envs/disco/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py:152: SymPyDeprecationWarning:

Using non-Expr arguments in Pow is deprecated (in this case, one of the
arguments is of type 'Tuple').

If you really did intend to construct a power with this base, use the **
operator instead.

See https://docs.sympy.org/latest/explanation/active-deprecations.html#non-expr-args-deprecated
for details.

This has been deprecated since SymPy version 1.7. It
will be removed in a future version of SymPy.
